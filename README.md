# structural-motion README

A VSCode plugin which allows you to move code structures (such as functions and classes) up and down with keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

Use the shortcuts Ctrl+Alt+Up or Ctrl+Alt+Down to move the structure under the cursor up or down.

This should work reasonably well in most languages for which VSCode has a good plugin. If a language plugin supports selection widening (Ctrl+Shift+Right) and also supports the "Outline" view (in the "Explorer" panel on the left) then Structural Motion has a good chance of working.

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.
